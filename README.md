HW 5 - Trivia Game

Random Movie Trivia
This game was created during week 5 of the UNC Coding Bootcamp.  The homework wanted a multiple choice game where the player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. The game is supposed to end when the time runs out (still working on this part). The page is also supposed to reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly and the game should not let the player pick more than one answer per question.

Instructions:
1)  Choose the correct multiple choice option for each question before the clock runs out and click the "submit" button when you are finished. 
2)  If you wish to replay click the "play again" button
